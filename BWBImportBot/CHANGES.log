# Notes

## 2020-09

2020-09 seems to have been run against an old script which did not produce line/entry numbers in the log and so it's difficult to match up where we left off to the original dataset.
Based on the number of "SUCCESS" entries (1,043,381) and "ERROR" entries (346,657), we can surmise that the number of records processed is ~1,390,038

The last entry in the log is book https://openlibrary.org/books/OL21998825M/Global_geomorphology whose title is "Global Geomorphilogy".

If we search for this in the books.jsonl source data by running the following:

```
mek@books-lists:/bwb-monthly/2020-09/Bibliographic$ grep "Global geomorphology" books.jsonl
1390038:{"isbn_13": ["9780582301566"], "publishers": ["Taylor & Francis Group"], "languages": ["eng"], "lc_classifications": ["GB401.5"], "publish_date": "1991", "source_records": ["bwb:9780582301566"], "title": "Global Geomorphology", "number_of_pages": "560", "authors": [{"name": "Summerfield, Michael A."}], "subjects": ["Geomorphology"]}
1491279:{"isbn_13": ["9781138837010"], "publishers": ["Taylor & Francis Group"], "languages": ["eng"], "lc_classifications": ["GB401.5.S82 2014"], "publish_date": "2015", "source_records": ["bwb:9781138837010"], "title": "Global Geomorphology", "number_of_pages": "560", "authors": [{"name": "Summerfield, Michael A."}], "subjects": ["Geomorphology"]}
3130092:{"isbn_13": ["9781317885115"], "publishers": ["Taylor & Francis Group"], "languages": ["eng"], "lc_classifications": ["GB401.5 .S82 2014"], "publish_date": "2014", "source_records": ["bwb:9781317885115"], "title": "Global Geomorphology", "number_of_pages": "560", "authors": [{"name": "Summerfield, Michael A."}], "subjects": ["Geomorphology"]}
3410725:{"isbn_13": ["9781317885108"], "publishers": ["Taylor & Francis Group"], "languages": ["eng"], "lc_classifications": [""], "publish_date": "2014", "source_records": ["bwb:9781317885108"], "title": "Global Geomorphology", "number_of_pages": "560", "authors": [{"name": "Summerfield, Michael A."}], "subjects": ["Geomorphology"]}
```

We get a match (title and author). The earliest appearance is line number 1,390,038 which exactly matches the total number of SUCCESS and ERROR responses we've seen.

So, we're going to edit the last line of our logs to start with "1390038:" so the runner starts from this point. You can refer to `tail /bwb-monthly/2020-08/Bibliographic/import.log` for an example which ends with:

1390038: SUCCESS: {"edition": {"status": "matched", "key": "/books/OL21998825M/"}, "work": {"status": "matched", "key": "/works/OL4781909W"}, "success": true}
